    2. Data In Open Formats
    3. Data Exportable
3. Good Looking UI
    1. Cross Platform
    2. HTTP API
4. Docker
5. No Buggy, No Laggy
6. Others
    1. Observable
    2. Extensible
    3. Backup

[1]: Open Source

Sustainable: open source may not be sufficient but very likely a necessary.  
Trust: I want nothing hiding.  

[1.1] Selfhosted As First-class Citizen

There are products who are open source, provide both cloud option and selfhosted option, but compromise features and priorities of selfhosted version, I don't like that.

[1.2] Actively Maintained

Good to know it's still evolving, at least there are still eyes and hands on bugs.

A bad smell here is outdated tech stack, like jQuery in 2025, gives me lower confidence in sustainable.

[1.4] Documentation

Documentation not only helps user understand, it's also a good sign of efficiency and quality.

[2] You Own Your Data

I don't like [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), when I go, I need to take my data with me.

I don't really own the data unless I can understand, interpret and manage the data.

[2.1] Data On My Disk

I want data on my disk (or my cloud), instead of on vendor's cloud, so I know I have maximum control, and only I do.

Plus, I want less dependencies for the app to run.

[2.2] Data In Open Formats

Open formats means more options, I'm less locked-in due to tech burdens.

[2.3] Data Exportable

I like apps who are open and supportive when users want to switch to another app, make data migration easy.

For certain scenarios, like database, special format is required to have better performance, I'm OK with that, as long as I can export data.

[3] Good Looking UI

[3.1] Cross Platform

[3.2] HTTP API

HTTP API is probably the most convenient and universal way to manage apps, UI and app core are decoupled, 3rd party UI available.

Automation is also much easier with HTTP API.

[4] Docker

Docker is preferred whenever applicable. Docker makes it easier to install / update / daemon / backup / monitor.

[5] No Buggy, No Laggy

[6.1] Observable

Not every app needs this, it's a bonus point.

[6.3] Backup

I would prefer backup done beyond the app layer, it's more universal for every app, so I don't expect the app itself to be very strong in this.

[6.5] Security

Security usually is not a big concern for me, not before I need to open some services to public internet.
