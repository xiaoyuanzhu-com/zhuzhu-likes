_zhuzhu_ is an enthusiast of **homelab**, he found it joyful to explore and create things, run things he controls. _zhuzhu_ had hosted many apps on his homelab servers, seen the lifecycle of softwares and communities, over the years, _zhuzhu_ started to prefer apps who have the following characters:

# Standard #1 - Open Source

I know I do, but someone tell me why?

## 1.1 - Selfhosted As First-class Citizen

There are products who are open source, and provide both cloud option and selfhosted option, sometimes compromise features and priorities of selfhosted version, I can understand but I don't like that.

# Standard #2 - I Own My Data

## 2.1 - I Own My Data, Legally

I want to be crystal clear on this.

## 2.2 - Data In Open Formats

I don't like [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), so either data is already in open format, like markdown, or can be exported to open formats easily.

# Standard #3 - Friendly UI

## 3.1 - Cross Platform

## 3.2 - Good Looking And Intuitive

# Standard #4 - Low Maintenance

## 4.1 - Run In Docker

## 4.2 - Documentation Or Community Support

# Standard #5 - Observable

Not every app has long-running services in the background, but when it does, I want to be able to monitor its status.

# Standard #6 - Extensible

Not every app needs extensibility, but when it does, I want to be capable.
