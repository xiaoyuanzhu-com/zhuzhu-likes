# zhuzhu-standard

_zhuzhu_ is an enthusiast of **homelab**, he found it joyful to explore and create things, run things he controls. _zhuzhu_ had hosted many apps on his homelab servers, seen the lifecycle of softwares and communities, over the years, _zhuzhu_ started to prefer apps who have the following characters:

# Standard #1 - Open Source

It's more about sustainable and trust.

Open source is not sufficient for sustainable, many open source project dies, but for live-long-and-prosper projects, open source community is very likely a necessary.

Trust is obvious here, I don't want any hiding things, not to say harmful, running in my homelab.

## 1.1 - Selfhosted As First-class Citizen

There are products who are open source, provide both cloud option and selfhosted option, but compromise features and priorities of selfhosted version, I don't like that.

## 1.2 - Actively Maintained

# Standard #2 - I Own My Data

## 2.1 - Data On My Disk

I want data on my disk (or my cloud), instead of on vendor's cloud, so I know I have maximum control, and only I do.

## 2.2 - Data In Open And Popular Formats

I don't really own the data unless I can understand, interpret and manage the data.

I don't like [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), so either data is already in open format, like markdown, or can be exported to open formats easily.

I like apps who are open and supportive when users want to switch to another app, they help users tranfer the data, instead of holding users back.

Popular format is also important, better ecosystem means more options.

### 2.2.1 - Special Data Format For Performance

For certain scenarios, like database, special format is required to have best performance, I'm OK with that, as long as I can export data.

# Standard #3 - Friendly UI

## 3.1 - Cross Platform

## 3.2 - Good Looking And Intuitive

## 3.3 - HTTP API

HTTP API is probably the most convenient and universal way to manage apps, UI and app core are decoupled, I may have more options in UI.

Automation is also much easier with HTTP API.

# Standard #4 - Low Maintenance

## 4.1 - Run In Docker

## 4.2 - Documentation Or Community Support

# Standard #5 - Observable

Not every app has long-running services in the background, but when it does, I want to be able to monitor its status.

# Standard #6 - Extensible

Not every app needs extensibility, but when it does, I want to be capable.
