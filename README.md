[1]: Open Source

Sustainable: open source may not be sufficient but very likely a necessary.  
Trust: I want nothing hiding.  
Community: wider support  

[1.1] Selfhosted As First-class Citizen

There are products who are open source, provide both cloud option and selfhosted option, but compromise features and priorities of selfhosted version, I don't like that.

[1.2] Actively Maintained

Good to know it's still evolving, at least there are still eyes and hands on bugs.

A bad smell here is outdated tech stack, like jQuery in 2025, gives me lower confidence in sustainable.

[2] You Own Your Data

I don't like [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), when I go, I need to take my data with me.

I don't really own the data unless I can understand, interpret and manage the data.

[2.1] Data On My Disk

I want data on my disk (or my cloud), instead of on vendor's cloud, so I know I have maximum control, and only I do.

[2.2] Data In Open Formats

Open formats means more options, I'm less locked-in due to tech limitations.

[2.3] Data Exportable

I like apps who are open and supportive when users want to switch to another app, make data migration easy.

For certain scenarios, like database, special format is required to have better performance, I'm OK with that, as long as I can export data.

[3] Good Looking UI

[3.1] Cross Platform

[3.2] HTTP API

HTTP API is probably the most convenient and universal way to manage apps, UI and app core are decoupled, 3rd party UI available.

Automation is also much easier with HTTP API.

[4] Docker

Docker makes it easier to install / update / daemon / backup / monitor.

[5] No Buggy, No Laggy
